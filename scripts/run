# For some reason, specifying the bundle in a relative way fails:
#     -Dosgi.bundles=reference:file:./buck-out/gen/src/com/bolinfest/jdt/main.jar@start \

# I tried starting org.eclipse.jdt.core, but it complained that the workspace was closed.
# This happens in org.eclipse.core.resources.ResourcesPlugin, so I tried adding
# org.eclipse.core.resources@1:start to the bundles list.

# Starting org.eclipse.core.resources exercised a code path that tried to instantiate a
# org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.LocalMetaArea. This called through to
# org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.assertInitialized(), which failed.
# The next step appears to be to start org.eclipse.core.runtime, though I am nervous about
# how many new transitive dependencies that will introduce. Much of the point of this
# exercise was to get the tooling of ECJ without pulling in the entire Eclipse runtime,
# but it seems like we are going further and further in that direction.

# TODO(bolinfest): Add the following back in once the below starts up cleanly.
# "-Dosgi.bundles=reference:file:${PWD}/buck-out/gen/src/com/bolinfest/jdt/main.jar@start"
